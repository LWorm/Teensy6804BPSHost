**All library notes are contained in the "New Library Notes ..." text file in the lib folder.**


Notes:
        * Comment all Error dependencies out until it has been converted. After all hardware libraries have been converted.
        * We will not be reusing "DC2100A" as it is heavily reliant on a custom RTOS which we will not be using.
        * "main.cpp" will be written as a loop to replace "DC2100A.cpp" in its entirety. An RTOS may be implemented in its place at a later date.
        * Debug and error reports will be sent over BOTH USB and CAN. Basic information will be sent over can as needed. Full detailed reports will be
          sent over USB serial upon request.


TASK #1:  The library "LTC6804-2" needs to be made compatible with the Teensy.
              * Replace SPI library and correct any compatibilities within the library. (Example implementation contained in the LTC6804-2 reference
               folder)
              * Replace I2C library and correct any compatibilities within the library. (May not actually be necessary.)

TASK #2  Begin writing "main.cpp" such that it reports verifiable data from the 6804 to a serial port.

TASK #3  The library "LTC1380" needs to be made compatible with the Teensy.

TASK #4  The library "Temperature" needs to be made compatible with the Teensy.

Task #5  Add temperature reporting to "main.cpp" and print over serial.
